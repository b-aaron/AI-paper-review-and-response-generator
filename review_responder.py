review_responder.py
Uses an LLM to draft author responses to each peer-review question.

For every question raised by the reviewer, the responder:
  1. Explains why the question / problem is valid or what misunderstanding it reflects.
  2. Proposes a concrete way to address or resolve the issue in a revised manuscript.
